          <h3>Transfer Of Data</h3>
          <p>
            Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to —
            and maintained on — computers located outside of your state,
            province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data
            protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are located outside Canada and choose to provide me your
            information, please note that we transfer the data, including
            Personal Data, to Canada and process it there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of
            such information represents your agreement to that transfer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data
            is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and
            no transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organization
            or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including
            the security of your data and other personal information.
          </p>

          <h3>Disclosure Of Data</h3>

          <h4>Legal Requirements</h4>
          <p>
            I may disclose your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such
            action is necessary to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>To comply with a legal obligation</li>
            <li>
              To protect and defend the rights or property of esarin.design
            </li>
            <li>
              To prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with
              the Service
            </li>
            <li>
              To protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the
              public
            </li>
            <li>To protect against legal liability</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Security Of Data</h3>
          <p>
            The security of your data is important to me, but remember that no
            method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
            storage is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially
            acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, I cannot guarantee
            its absolute security.
          </p>

          <h3>Service Providers</h3>
          <p>
            I may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate my
            service ("Service Providers"), to provide the service on our behalf,
            to perform service-related services or to assist us in analyzing how
            our Service is used.
          </p>
          <p>
            These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to
            perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose
            or use it for any other purpose.
          </p>

          <h3>Analytics</h3>
          <p>
            I may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyze the
            use of our Service.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
              <p>
                Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google
                that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data
                collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data
                is shared with other Google services. Google may use the
                collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its
                own advertising network.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service
                available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics
                opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics
                JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing
                information with Google Analytics about visits activity.
