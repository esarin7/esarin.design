            <h6>Agricultural Coop Website</h6>
            <p>
              <strong>Experience</strong> Trained 122 agricultural organizations across Colombia on how to use and maintain their websites created with content management system (CMS) platform (Wix). Training included photography and content production focusing on basic SEO writing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Tools</strong> Wix, SEO, Google Analytics
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Objective</strong> The two main goals were: to train farmers to be sustainable in the maintenance of their websites and to use them as a marketing tool.

            <h6>Mondo Vino Wine Tours</h6>
            <p>
              <strong>Experience</strong> As an oenophile, I enjoyed developing this website. During the creation process, I became aware of the importance of reflecting a business' model and operations in an efficient and accessible manner. It was also a good exercise to reflect on issues such as, the type of booking forms that would be most beneficial to them or what marketing tools (newsletters, social media content) can they support. I need to work on improving the site's responsiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Tools</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Lightroom (for image editing).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Objective</strong> To create an effective, clear, promotional website for a small business that would be able to take online reservations (no payments).<br> I featured South African wines because I'm very familiar with its wine region as a former resident of this gorgeous country.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Process</strong> 
              <ul>
                <li>+ Extensive research.</li>
                <li>+ Collection and selection of visual assets that would establish the business brand and personality.</li>
                <li>+ Writing appealing content in an inviting yet not too informal tone.</li>
                <li>+ Many hours of self-motivation, video tutorials, and frantic note taking (yes, I still take notes using the analog tools of pen and paper) following numerous existential crises while trying to understand and use JavaScript, a language I'm still trying to figure out.</li>

            <h6>A Tyrion Lannister Quote Carousel [in progress]</h6>
            <p>
              <strong>Experience</strong> I enjoyed coming up with the concept for this project, as one of the legions of fans of the TV show, <i>Game of Thrones,</i> but getting it right took me a long series of trials and errors and frustrations. However, once it worked, I felt giddy by the result. I need to work on improving the responsiveness of certain elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Tools</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Photoshop (for PNG and SVG editing)
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Objective</strong> To create a little homage to one of my favourite TV characters, trying to avoid visual clich√©s - quotes by this character are usually featured with an image of him drinking wine.<br> I also wanted to feature quotes that on their own can be appreciated by anyone who has never watched the show (How?! Not even an episode?).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Process</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>+ Extensive research and curation of quotes.</li>
                <li>+ Playing around with SVGs for the background.</li>
                <li>+ Agonizing with the JavaScript features to create two functions, the rotation of the quotes given a determined time, and the clicking by the user at any time.</li>
                <li>+ <i>I want to increase the number of quotes, add other minimal animation features and include a section featuring a dynamic infographic detailing Tyrion's wine consumption through the show's eight seasons.</i></li>

            <h6>The Happy Wandering Bus [in progress]</h6>
            <p>
              <strong>Experience</strong> From the first time I saw it, I adored the little bus (adapted as a PNG from a GIF created by Dutch illustrator, Niek Gooren, shared with permission) and I knew I had to somehow use it in a project.<br> However, making it move took days of understanding and playing around with JQuery, and I still didn't make it work properly as I ended up with a bus wandering off the screen and if it were taking a drive around my computer's monitor.<br>But with the support (and patience) of my webdev instructor, the wandering of the little bus was contained. This is still a project in process with a few details to fine-tune, like responsiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Tools</strong> HTML, CSS, JQuery, Photoshop
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Objective</strong> What started as simply wanting to use this colourful bus in my work, has ended up becoming a long term project. The current text, created using background clipping, is acting as a placeholder. I'm currently studying how to create dynamic words because I want the car facts to be dynamic.<br>Ultimately I want this to be a micro-site that features succint facts about car accident fatalities in Canada and tips on good driving. I would like it to feature a few more animated vehicles and a dynamic landscape.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Process</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>+ Days of JQuery research and study and trials and errors.</li>
                <li>+ Learning from my instructor how to understand the JQuery code.</li>

            <h6>Supper Studio's eCommerce Redesign [group project]</h6>
            <p>
              <strong>Experience</strong> Working on a group project was a good and challenging experience. We all identified our strengths, based on that, we adopted different tasks. It was also a good exercise where we had to negotiate our different work processes and collectively think how to solve problems.  
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Tools</strong> WordPress, plugins and extensions, Woo Commerce, SEO.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Objective</strong> We took an existing local business website that offers healthy meals and identified that its online purchase system was not a seamless experience for the user. We created a more straight forward process and added extra features like product merchandise.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Process</strong> I was responsible for content creation (descriptions, prices, collection of images) and SEO as well as the creation of the product merchandise section.
